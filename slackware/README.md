# Slackware

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/), first released in July 1993 by Patrick Volkerding, is the oldest Linux distro still maintained.  

## Milestones

Version 1.0 started out as a collection of patches and new packages for the Softlanding Linux System (SLS). It used the same `doinstall`/`sysinstall` scripts and SLS packages could be installed directly.

Version 1.1 saw the install and package management scripts rewritten at the request of SLS author Peter MacDonald, who objected to other distributions using them. The `setup` script replaced `doinstall` and `pkgtool` replaced `sysinstall`. 1.1.2 introduced the color `dialog`-based scripts that are still used by Slackware today.
