Welcome to the Walnut Creek CDROM Toolkit for Linux CDROM, Disc One
This CDROM is actually a pair of CDROMs. This first disc contains
the Slackware Linux distribution, the Slackware sources, contents
of the tsx-11 Linux archive, and "je", a package of extensions
to linux so that it can deal with Japanese.

The second disk contains the contents of the sunsite Linux archive.

**********************************************************************
In order to install the Slackware Linux distribution onto your system,
look at the file slackware/INSTALL.TXT. (From MS-DOS it is
\SLACKWA0\INSTALL.TXT.) Wherever the documentation references
something in /pub/Linux on sunsite.unc.edu, those files can be found
on the second CD, in in the "sunsite" directory.

Because MS-DOS can't handle long filenames, some of the filenames
when accessed using MS-DOS will be different. The files 00_TRANS.TBL
describe the mappings.  In particular, the directories needed for the
installation which look different are:

slackware               SLACKWA0
bootdsks.12             BOOTDSK0      
bootdsks.144            BOOTDSK1
rootdsks.12             ROOTDSK0
rootdsks.144            ROOTDSK1

When the installation program asks you where the source media is,
choose "from CDROM", and for the directory containing the slackware
installation choose "Custom" and then slackware/slakware.

======================================================================
(Directories below are listed first as how they look under UNIX
with the Rockridge Extensions, and then second as they look under
MS-DOS with short filenames)

Disc 1:

A) slackware            Slackware Linux package.  This is a complete
   SLACKWA0             Unix like system containing everything you
                        expect in a commericial package and more.

B) slackware_source     Slackware Linux sources. These are the complete
   SLACKWA1             sources used to build the Slackware Linux
                        package.

C) je                   Japanese Extensions.  Adds Japanese language
   JE                   capability to your Linux system.

   TSX_11
 
E) sunsite/GCC          The GCC directory from the sunsite archive.
   SUNSITE\GCC          This directory was  placed on the first disc
                        because there wasn't enough space on the second
                        disc to fit the entire sunsite archive.

Disc 2:

A) sunsite              The sunsite Linux archive. A large repository
   SUNSITE              of products for Linux.  Existing Linux users can
                        find the latest gcc compilers, c libraries, and
                        X windows packages to upgrade their systems.

B) misc			Miscellaneous utilities and files from the
   MISC                 ftp.cdrom.com ftp site which don't fit anyplace
                        else.
