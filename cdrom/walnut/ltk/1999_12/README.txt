readme.txt            Information about this cdrom
catalog.txt           Walnut Creek CDROM Catalog
doc/                  RedHat Documentation
images/               Boot disk images
COPYING               License terms for software on this CDROM

===============================================================================

Quick start instructions:

  To install one of the Linux distributions contained on discs 1, 2, 3, or
  4 you will need to either boot from the CDROM or create a boot disk.  To
  create a boot disk from a DOS or Windows machine, simply run the 'view'
  program from the root directory of the CDROM.

  To install Linux software on disc 6 onto an existing Linux
  system, insert the CDROM into your drive and mount it:

        mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /cdrom

  See the man page for mount if you are unfamiliar with its syntax.


Red Hat Linux Documentation

The Red Hat Linux v6.1 Installation Guide is in HTML format.  It
is in the doc/rhinst directory.

Under Linux, point your web browser to:

  /cdrom/doc/rhinst/index.htm
  (assuming /cdrom is where your Red Hat Linux cdrom is mounted)

Under Windows, point your web browser to:

  D:\doc\rhinst\index.htm
  (assuming D: is your cdrom drive)


Red Hat Upgrades

The boot.img, bootnet.img and pcmcia.img floppy disk images,
located in the images directory, originally contained a bug
that would produce an error if you attempted to upgrade your
version of Red Hat to v6.1.

The fixed versions of these images are on this CDROM. You will
need two floppy disks for the upgrade to work. Create the first
floppy disk using one of the three files mentioned in the last
paragraph, and the second floppy disk using the updates.img
file. 

Upgrading will not work if you have the CDROM in the drive when
the system boots. That means you will not be able to boot off
of the CDROM when upgrading. You must boot off of one of the
floppy disks. The installation process will prompt you to
insert the CDROM when it is required.

After booting with the first floppy disk, type in "linux updates"
at the boot: prompt, followed by any other installation options
that are required (such as "expert" or "text"). The installation
process will prompt you to insert the updates disk when it is
required, then the install will proceed as normal.
