  you will need to either boot from the CDROM or create a boot disk.  To
  create a boot disk from a DOS or Windows machine, simply run the 'view'
  program from the root directory of the CDROM.

  To install Linux software on discs 4, 5, and 6 onto an existing Linux
  system, insert the CDROM into your drive and mount it:
