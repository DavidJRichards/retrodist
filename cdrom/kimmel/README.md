# Kimmel's Linux Distro CD-ROMS

Internet Archive user [kimmel](https://archive.org/details/@kimmel) uploaded a lot of ISOs for old Linux distros, including some Slackware ISOs that are not availble from the official mirror or Walnut Creek. 

I have collected the URLs for the Slackware ISOs that were not available elsewhere since downloading the ISOs is faster than downloading the individual files from the official mirror.

No documentation is provided about the origin of these images, but I have spot-checked the slackware directory on Slackware 9.0 disc 1 and verified that the files on the ISO match those on the official mirror.
