> Slackware pre-1.0 beta, based on Linux 0.99.pl8-3 (04/10/93), is provided
here just for fun.  It's known to NOT be Y2K ready, and has any number of
bugs that have been fixed over the years.  So, try not to use it for your
most important server. :)

[grem75](https://archive.org/details/slackware-beta) uploaded a version to archive.org with the description:

> On the old Slackware repository were some files of the earliest known Slackware builds about a month before 1.0 was released. These didn't include X disks and the folder naming was wrong.
>
>After some digging I found SLS 1.02 X disks to be compatible. This may have been the original intention, that information seems to be lost. The T disks work as well. Everything should be installable, I've done it including X in PCem.
>
>This has Linux kernel 0.99pl9, libc 4.3.3 and XFree86 1.2.
