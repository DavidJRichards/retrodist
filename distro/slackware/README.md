# Slackware

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/), first released in July 1993 by Patrick Volkerding, is the oldest Linux distro still maintained.  

Version 1.0 started out as a collection of patches and new packages to SLS. It  used the same install scripts and SLS packages could be installed directly. The install scripts were rewritten in Version 1.1 at the request of SLS author Peter MacDonald, who objected to other distributions using his install scripts.
