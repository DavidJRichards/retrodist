# Debian

[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) was established in August 1993 by Ian Murdock, who published a [manifesto](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html) outlining the project's goals. Like Slackware, it was created out of frustration with the bugs in SLS.  More historical information is on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian).
